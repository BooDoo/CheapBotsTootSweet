It's time to start managing this under a unified project, for my sanity's sake.


# TODO:  
  ## frontend:
  - [ ] Count raw characters and ditch `twitter-text`?  
  - [ ] Page suggesting charitable orgs in lieu of financial support  
  - [ ] Add beeping.town server recommendation (after confirming Pleroma is OK)  
  - [ ] Get even more specific with callback URI so test instance port is taken into account  
  - [ ] Branch/submit PR to [MastodonOAuthPHP](https://github.com/TheCodingCompany/MastodonOAuthPHP) with patches  
  - [ ] translation/internationalization layer?

  ## backend:
  - [ ] Respect direct/private/unlisted flags when replying to mentions  
  - [ ] Clean up log line format/calls  
  - [ ] Genericize some copypasta?  
  - [ ] write tests. I know, *I know*, but you really need to.  

  ## send_status (Bridge):  
  - [ ] Integrate Raven/Sentry.io error reporting?  
  - [ ] Build tests (lol right)
